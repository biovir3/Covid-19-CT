# Covid-19-CT
Taking CT imaging data, and using TensorFlow to identify segments of Covid-19 Infection

The Kaggle CT imaging has the base CT scan, a Lung Mask, and an infection mask.

This will be done in two ways, Image Segmentation, and Object Detection.

Segmentation will segment the images and give the location of the lung, and infection
in the images.

Object Detection will give a Part of Lung detected in the image, and an infection detected
in the image.
